Griefers will be banned without warning.

I reserve the right to delete natter at any time.

I am not going to go into laborous detail in defining the term griefer nor the term
natter. A quick internet search will reveal an approximate meaning. If I have to get
into a debate about whether outrageous behavior was acceptible I have already lost.
